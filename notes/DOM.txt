DOM -> Document Object Model
	Structured representation of HTML document
	DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JS

QuerySelector selects the first element it finds
textContent -> change the text but it only sets the plain text no HTML
innerHTML -> change the text with styles

Events: notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happened to that web page
Event listener: A fn that performs an action based on a certain event. It waits for a specific event to happen


Anonymous fn: It's a fn that doesn't have a name, so we can't reuse


getElementById is faster than querySelector

State Variable: It tells us the condition of the system
